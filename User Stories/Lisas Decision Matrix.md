Lisa lookes at her half empty fridge at 6pm in the evening. It only contains some cooked noodles carrots. One can make a dish of that, but it would be kinda boring. Lisa is not really in the mood for that, but she can't get Pizza delivery again. She takes out her phone and opens her Daily Helper app. She touches the button to create a desicion matrix. A window opens with a 6x2 table to fill out. As the two options: "roasted noodles with carrots" or "Pizza delivery". The categories on the left she fills with: "immediate pleasure" and "lasting pleasure" always good options, she has to remember to save that as a template matrix. The other fields are "health", "money". She needs to consider the last one for a bit. Desicion matrixes can be difficult but they are always worth it. Finally she enters "time". Delivery actually takes longer. How hungry is Lisa? 
The noodles get the values: "immediate pleasure": 3, "lasting pleasure": 7, "health": 8, "money": 0, "time": 9; "gut feeling": 4
The pizza gets the valus: "immediate pleasure": 9, "lasting pleasure": 2, "health": -5, "money": -7, "time": 3; "gut feeling": 5

Noodles win with 31:7. Wow. Lisa did not expect such a big difference. Happily she takes the noodles and carrots out of the fidge. Her weight of the decision lifted of her, she enjoys her meal.
